🚀 Launching the Opera Nitro Promotion Generator! 🚀

🔍 This script is designed to fetch a unique token from the Opera GX API by cleverly mimicking a browser request, complete with headers. 🌐🔒

🎯 Upon a successful request, it skillfully extracts the token from the JSON response. 📄🔑

🔄 Then, it crafts a new URL incorporating the token, displays it, and securely stores it in a text file for your convenience. 🖇️💾

⏳ The script operates in an endless loop, with a thoughtful pause of 0.5 seconds between each iteration. This is to ensure we don't overwhelm the servers. ⏳💤

⚠️ Important Note: This script is a prototype and may not be optimized for long-term use. ⚠️🛠️

📌 Disclaimer: This script is intended for educational purposes only. Always ensure you're in compliance with the terms of use of any API you interact with. 📌📜

🔧 Usage: To get started, simply run the script. Watch as it generates your unique promotion URLs! 🔧🎉

🎈 Enjoy the streamlined and efficient process of the Opera Nitro Promotion Generator! 🎈🎊

📝 Note: You may need to tweak the headers and the sleep interval to suit your specific needs and to respect the server's rate limit policies. 📝🔄
