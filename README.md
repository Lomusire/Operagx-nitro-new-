# 🚀 Opera Nitro Promotion Generator 🚀

## 🔍 Fetching Unique Tokens

This script is designed to fetch a unique token from the Opera GX API by mimicking a browser request, complete with headers. Upon a successful request, it extracts the token from the JSON response.

## 🔄 Constructing and Saving URLs

After obtaining the token, it constructs a new URL incorporating the token, displays it, and securely stores it in a text file for future reference.

## ⏳ Running Indefinitely

The script operates in an endless loop, with a deliberate pause of 0.5 seconds between each iteration to avoid overwhelming the servers.

## ⚠️ Important Note

This script is a prototype and may not be optimized for long-term use.

## 📌 Disclaimer

This script is intended for educational purposes only. Always ensure you're in compliance with the terms of use of any API you interact with.

## 🔧 Usage

To get started, simply run the script. Watch as it generates your unique promotion URLs!

## 📝 Note

You may need to adjust the headers and the sleep interval depending on your use case and the server's rate limit policies.
